      Picking just one favoite romance movie is a challenge. But I feel I may
      have narrowed it down to just three... There are so many more but there
      isn't enough time for them all on one little page.
      <br />
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Practical Magic</li>
      <li>Star Dust</li>
      <li>The Princess Bride</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are my top personal favorite movies, and I feel many could agree.
      These movies are classic and hold more than the mushy lovey dovey stuff.
      They contain action scenes, comedy and drama and of course... love!
      <br /><br />
      They wouldn't be <span class="genre">"romance movies"</span> without it! I
      feel they have a little something for the whole family to enjoy, or for
      one individual who just wants to curl up and enjoy some time spent being
      taken away to a new world.
